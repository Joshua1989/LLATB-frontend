    <h1>Edit Your User Profile</h1>
    <h2>Using Third-Party Proxy</h2>
    <p>If you are using a third-party proxy <a href='//stats.llsif.win/'>SIFStats (JP)</a>, <a href='http://pll.sokka.cn/user'>LLproxy (CN)</a>, then you can directly copy the user profile JSON to input your card list.</p>
    <div style='display: block;margin: 0 auto' style='width:100%'>
        <img src="{% static 'tutorial_en 2.jpg' %}" style='width:48%;display:inline-block;'>
        <img src="{% static 'tutorial_en 3.jpg' %}" style='width:48%;display:inline-block;'>
    </div>
    <h2>Using School Idol Tomodachi Account</h2>
    <p>If you have an account at <a href='http://schoolido.lu/'>School Idol Tomodachi</a>, then you can directly import your account.</p>
    <div style='display: block;margin: 0 auto' align='middle' style='width:60%'>
        <img src="{% static 'tutorial_en 9.png' %}" style='width:48%;display:inline-block;'>
    </div>
    <p>One thing you should keep in mind is that SIT does not contain the information of level and bond, by default all imported cards are max level and max bond.</p>
    <h2>Using Minaraishi's Team Builder Profile</h2>
    <p>If you have used <a href='https://designedfor.sakura.ne.jp/nikuma-n/'>Minaraishi's team builder</a>, then you can directly copy the exported file as user JSON, the LLATB will convert the format automatically.</p>
    <div style='display: block;margin: 0 auto' align='middle' style='width:60%'>
        <img src="{% static 'tutorial_en 10.png' %}" style='width:60%;display:inline-block;'>
    </div>
    <h2>Manually Edit Card Profile</h2>
    <p>If you are not use a third-party proxy, you can still use this tool by editing your profile manually. The editing is incremental, if you first copy user profile JSON and then edit manually, you will start from the profile in the JSON.</p>
    <p>Or if you have the data from minaraishi's team builder, you can also copy it here, now LLATB supports minaraishi's format!</p>
    <img src="{% static 'tutorial_en 4.png' %}" align='middle'>
    <p>When you add a card, first you need to choose which member, attribute and whether it is idolized to filter out all card satisfying these conditions.</p>
    <img src="{% static 'tutorial_en 5.png' %}" align='middle'>
    <p>Then two sets of card will show below:
        <ul>
            <li> the first set contains all possible cards available in the game that satisfies the filter </li>
            <li> the second set contains all your cards that satisfies the filter </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>You can add a new card by clicking an icon in the first set, then it will appear in the second set, by default the card has minimum number of slots, skill level 1, max level and bond.</p>
    <p>You can edit an existing card by clicking an icon in the second set, then the following modal will pop up for you to change card stats. The only thing you need to notice is that if you changed the idolization, the edited will disappear from the second set since it does not satisfy the current filter (idolization does not match).</p>
    <img src="{% static 'tutorial_en 6.png' %}" align='middle' style='width:60%'>
    <p>After you finished editing all your cards, you may want to edit the number of all gems, simply click "Edit Gem" button and input the numbers.</p>
    <img src="{% static 'tutorial_en 7.png' %}" align='middle' style='width:60%'>
    <p>Now you are done, it is simple right? Do not forget to click "Save" before you click "Build" to build your optimal team. And I highly recommend you to save the user JSON locally in case of losing information.</p>
    <h1>Manage Your Profile</h1> The newest version allows you to conveniently switch different user profiles. To import/overwrite an existing user profile, or create a new user profile, simple click <b>"User JSON"</b> button, and then hover on the text <b>User Profile JSON</b>, then you can see the text turns green and becomes <b>Switch Local Profile</b>. You can open the local profile manager by clicking on this text.

    <img src="{% static 'tutorial_en 12.png' %}" align='middle' style='width:60%'>
    <p><b>Note:</b> The local profile management is only available in team building page, there is no such function in team strength page.</p>
    <h1>Build Optimal Team</h1>
    <img src="{% static 'tutorial_en 1.png' %}" align='middle'>
    <h2>Configure Settings</h2>
    <p>Once you created a valid user profile, simply choose all parameters:
        <ul>
            <li>Live List: the live(s) you want to optimize over: this team builder support Medley Festival, under same group, attribute and difficulty, you can add at most 5 songs</li>
            <li>Buy Support: this is useful when you are in a Medley Festival or Challenge Festival</li>
            <li>Prior Perfect Rate: this is used for evaluating how well you play the game, it is the average probability that you tap a PERFECT in absence of any perfect lock skills. Note that all computation are based on Full Combo presumption, Prior Perfect Rate is 0.95 means your taps are 95% PERFECT and 5% GREAT.</li>
            <li>Gem Unlimited: just a setting to discard gem owning constraints, this may tell you what gem is more valuable in your following game progress</li>
            <li>Extra Condition: you can choose extra conditions to see your potentials:
                <ul>
                    <li>Maintain Current: nothing changes, cards information strictly follows what you input in user profile JSON</li>
                    <li>Max Lv & Bond: All cards maintain current idolization, but are set to max level and max bond</li>
                    <li>Idlz, Max Lv & Bond: All cards set to idolized, but are set to max level and max bond, slot number unchanged</li>
                    <li>Idlz, Lv 8 & Slot Max: This is the ultimate status, all cards set to idolized, but are set to max level and max bond, besides the skill level is 8 and maximize the slot number.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Team Build Results</h2>
    <p>Whew, finally you can press the "Calculate" button, there is no error showing, congratulations your optimal team is available! Enjoy!!!</p>
    <p>Here is an example output. For ordinary users, what you may be interested in are:
        <ul>
            <li>Cover Rate in Total Stats: The estimated note cover rate for perfect lock.</li>
            <li>Expected Score in Total Stats: The expected score you can obtain using the optimal team.</li>
            <li>Recommended Guest Center Skill: The best guest you should use in traditional icon collect event and when there is no event.</li>
            <li>Icon & Gem: Of course this is why you use the LLSIF-AutoTeamBuilder</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>For technical users, I am open to discussion and glad to share idea. Feel free to contact me.</p>

    <h2>Validate Output by Simulation</h2>
    <img src="{% static 'tutorial_en 13.png' %}" align='middle' style='width:70%'>
    <p>This feature is add at July 24, 2017. As long as the live you are optimizing on is not default live (which does not have note list), you can run a simulation to see
        <ul>
            <li>The distribution of game scoring over 5000 trials.</li>
            <li>The average score obtained by the base attribute, and skill for each card, the average score obtained by Trick SIS for each card.</li>
            <li>The fraction of each note to be covered by P-lock over 5000 trials.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
